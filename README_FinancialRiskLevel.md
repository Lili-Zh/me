# Financial Risk Level Prediction using Supervised Learning

**Lili Zheng**  

## Executive Summary

**Project Overview and Goals:**  
This project aims to develop a reliable and interpretable machine learning system for predicting individuals' financial risk levels based on structured personal and financial data. We use four supervised classification modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoostâ€”to predict whether an individual falls into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** financial risk categories.

We compare the models based on **accuracy**, **recall**, and **F1 score** to identify the best-performing model, which is then analyzed further using global and local interpretability techniques such as **feature importance** and **class probability breakdown**.

## Methodology

**Data Source:**  
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains survey-style structured financial and demographic information. Each record includes features like age, income, education, loan status, and credit score, along with a labeled risk rating.

**Preprocessing:**  
- Missing values were handled.
- Categorical variables were label-encoded.
- Credit Score and Age were binned into ordinal categories.
- Train-test split was done (75% training, 25% testing).
- Target variable (`Risk Rating`) was encoded into ordinal labels (0=Low, 1=Medium, 2=High).

**Models Trained:**  
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

All models were trained on the same dataset and evaluated using the same metrics.

## Model Selection Summary

After comparing all models, **Random Forest** achieved the best performance in terms of overall accuracy, strong recall, and balanced F1 scores across all classes.

| Model               | Accuracy | Recall  | F1 Score |
|--------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| ~0.83    | ~0.80   | ~0.81    |
| Decision Tree      | ~0.77    | ~0.75   | ~0.76    |
| Random Forest      | **0.86** | **0.84**| **0.85** |
| XGBoost            | ~0.85    | ~0.83   | ~0.84    |

ðŸ’¡ Based on this analysis, **Random Forest** was selected as the final model for interpretability and application.

## Evaluation of Best Model: Random Forest

### Global Interpretability
Feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model shows that the most influential predictors of financial risk include:
- **Credit Score**
- **Annual Income**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Employment Status**
- **Age Category**

This aligns with financial domain knowledge, enhancing trust and actionability for business use.

### Local Explanation
We also evaluated the prediction probabilities for individual samples to interpret model decisions on a case-by-case basis. This helps understand how confident the model is when assigning a risk label and supports risk management applications.

### Business Implication
This model can help **banks**, **insurers**, and **fintech firms**:
- Pre-screen loan applicants
- Set interest rates based on risk profile
- Recommend financial products more effectively

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model shows excellent predictive performance and interpretability. It captures key financial indicators to make accurate and explainable predictions, making it highly applicable in real-world risk assessment systems.

## Future Work

1. **Model Improvements:**
   - Conduct hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Implement ensemble techniques combining multiple models.

2. **Fairness and Bias:**
   - Assess bias across demographic groups (e.g., age, gender).

3. **Deployment:**
   - Package the model as an API for integration into web apps or financial services platforms.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Add more granular credit history data and behavioral features.

5. **Explainability:**
   - Add advanced tools like **SHAP** for richer explanations once environment supports it.
