This project aims to develop a predictive model for used car prices, enabling a dealership to optimize pricing and inventory decisions. Following the CRISP-DM framework, a vehicle listing dataset was analyzed. Data preparation included cleaning, feature engineering (age, transmission), and transformation (standardization, one-hot encoding). Regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) were implemented to predict log-transformed prices. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and relevant metrics. Ridge Regression offered a balance of accuracy and interpretability, Lasso performed feature selection, and Random Forest captured non-linear patterns. Key findings show that newer cars, lower mileage, automatic transmissions, and well-known manufacturers (e.g., Toyota, Ford) are positively associated with higher prices, while older, high-mileage vehicles and less common body types tend to be less valuable. These insights provide a data-driven foundation for strategic pricing and inventory management.
